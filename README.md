# Tweakio
Search packages globally directly from your favourite package manager! Works with Cydia, Installer, Zebra and Sileo!

## How does it work
The tweak adds an extra tab to each package manager or a button to the default search tab, as you can see in the `.x` files. What's in the extra tab/button is the Tweakio view controller. The Tweakio search utilizes a restAPI, such as the Tweakio API, Parcility API, Canister API and iOS Repo Updates API. In order to choose the API (default is Tweakio API), you simply open the in-app settings in the Tweakio tab, and then choose the API.
