# Tweakio
Search packages globally directly from your favourite package manager! Works with Cydia, Installer, Zebra and Sileo!

## How does it work
The tweak adds an extra tab to each package manager or a button to the default search tab, as you can see in the `.x` files. What's in the extra tab/button is the Tweakio view controller. The Tweakio search utilizes a restAPI, such as the Tweakio API, Parcility API, Canister API and iOS Repo Updates API. In order to choose the API (default is Tweakio API), you simply open the in-app settings in the Tweakio tab, and then choose the API.

## Differences between the APIs
* Tweakio API - Made by me, [Spartacus](https://github.com/SpartacusDev). Completely open sourced. Slow, contains over 500 repos, gives most results.
* Parcility API - Made by the [Zenith Team](https://github.com/ZenithDevs). Fast, contains over 600 repos.
* Canister API - Made by [Tale](https://github.com/tale). Fast, used in Sileo as a built-in feature, has exact price for each package.
* iOS Repo Updates API - Made by [relisiuol](https://github.com/relisiuol). Fast, tells exact price for a package, piracy-free and no offline repos.
If in doubt, I suggest either iOS-Repo-Updates or Canister.

# Found an issue?
Please either file an issue here in the GitHub repo (I may not see it fast, which is why I suggest the second method more, which is:) or tell me the issue in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mZZhnRDGeg)
